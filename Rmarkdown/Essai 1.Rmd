This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a *document* will be ***generated*** that includes both content as well as the output of any <<embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, eval= FALSE}
plot(pressure)
a <- 2,234567890987
```

Note that the `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. La valeur de a est `r round (a,2)`.
